Tired of RimWorld children with the work ethic of corporate lawyers? So were we!
This mod finally lets kids be kids! Our little colonists will now:
<h5>• Actually play together instead of contemplating the void</h5>
<h5>• Use recreational buildings for social fun (imagine that!)</h5>
<h5>• Gain social joy from group activities instead of solo hoopstone</h5>
<h5>• Develop properly because playtime is learning time!</h5>
Watch as your colony's children form friendships, play tag near the chess tables, and remind your grim colonists that even on the rim... there's still time for recess.

Perfect for colonies that believe childhood shouldn't be 100% hauling duty.
